            "And we now get you the story of the miraculous escape of the passenger of Providence. Yes, sources tell India today that uh the reason he got saved was because he landed between two buildings. The survivor had fallen on soft soil and that primarily saved the impact of his fall. That is how he managed to walk out. Vishwas Kumar the only survivor in that air crash where sources tell India today that uh the point at which he landed between two buildings there was no blast inside the aircraft and that is how passenger 11A Bishwas Kumar the only survivor of the Ahmedabad plane crash walked out after that devastating incident. Let me cut across to Amit Bhardwan joining us with further details. Amit, truly miraculous. You know, everyone has wondered how this happened and I believe you're picking up more details of uh primarily the fact that he landed between two buildings and landed on soft soil. These are the kind of incidents that remind us that there is a higher power and uh the one who's destined to live will live on. I believe he's devastated also because of the fact that his brother did not survive and the final rights happened. Vishwar Kuskumar's survival is a story the world will remember. Uh right sha you know if you go by the details that India today has been told by top sources you know there there was this question from day one as to how did Vishwas Kumar survive and no one else could who were part of that flight AI71. Uh so if you look at uh the structure of the complex where this crash has happened, the tail landed on the mess building of BJ Medical College hostel and the cockpit landed around Atulam 4 which was the residential complex of the uh super speciality doctors and uh this uh 11A passenger that is Vispas Kumar Romesh he was sitting on 11 A1 11 alpha and you know he landed at a spot because of this positioning he he was right in the middle of the two buildings and he landed on a spot which had soft soil because of this the impact of this got really reduced and he could actually walk out of the complex well in time. Not only that you know there have been a lot of questions about whether within the flight there could have been something untoward uh that the agencies could have been looking at at this point in time. Uh the top sources are also telling us that on prime of it looks like there was no possible blast within uh the aircraft otherwise he couldn't have walked safely uh the way he did eventually on that day first from the craft and uh next when he landed on soft soil he was able to walk out. Now having said that I spoke to Vishwasumar lastuh night Suesha and I can certainly tell you that in his voice I could uh uh you know gather a sense that he's actually now realizing the calamity that he is facing and his family is facing this craft on which he was on board AI 171. Not only 241 pe 241 people died and it included his own younger brother and uh last night he was actually traveling back to his hometown with the mortal remains of his younger brother. So that emotional trauma uh was taking over him at that point in time as uh I spoke to him last uh last night and all he could say last night was that you know he's feeling better. The doctors told him that he's doing well and he's going on for the cremation. So he could not even gather as to what all process would be involved in the cremation or the final rights of his brother. But he did mention that you know I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow but I'm going for the cremation to my hometown. Uh so clearly he's now realizing the kind of emotional trauma that he's going through and now the top sources within the establishment has confirmed us that he could survive because he landed on soft soil within the BJ Medical College hostel complex. Back to you. Oh yes Amit, it can be overwhelming for anyone. Uh so much to process in such little time. Vishwas Kumar the lone survivor of Air India Ahmedabad plane crash who attended his brother's funeral. Both of them were on the same flight. His brother could not survive but he did. The lone survivor, the only one who managed to come out safe in that flight that crashed and claimed more than 27 lives. Vishwas Kumar not being able to process how he got saved and his brother could not survive this crash. He's still recovering from the injuries and he was at his brother's cremation yesterday.

These are the kind of incidents that remind us that there is a higher power and uh the one who's destined to live will live on. I believe he's devastated also because of the fact that his brother did not survive and the final rights happened. Vishwar Kuskumar's survival is a story the world will remember. Uh right sha you know if you go by the details that India today has been told by top sources you know there there was this question from day one as to how did Vishwas Kumar survive and no one else could who were part of that flight AI71. Uh so if you look at uh the structure of the complex where this crash has happened, the tail landed on the mess building of BJ Medical College hostel and the cockpit landed around Atulam 4 which was the residential complex of the uh super speciality doctors and uh this uh 11A passenger that is Vispas Kumar Romesh he was sitting on 11 A1 11 alpha and\\n\\nof them were on the same flight. His brother could not survive but he did. The lone survivor, the only one who managed to come out safe in that flight that crashed and claimed more than 27 lives. Vishwas Kumar not being able to process how he got saved and his brother could not survive this crash. He's still recovering from the injuries and he was at his brother's cremation yesterday. [Music] [Applause] [Music]\\n\\nbetter. The doctors told him that he's doing well and he's going on for the cremation. So he could not even gather as to what all process would be involved in the cremation or the final rights of his brother. But he did mention that you know I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow but I'm going for the cremation to my hometown. Uh so clearly he's now realizing the kind of emotional trauma that he's going through and now the top sources within the establishment has confirmed us that he could survive because he landed on soft soil within the BJ Medical College hostel complex. Back to you. Oh yes Amit, it can be overwhelming for anyone. Uh so much to process in such little time. Vishwas Kumar the lone survivor of Air India Ahmedabad plane crash who attended his brother's funeral. Both of them were on the same flight. His brother could not survive but he did. The lone survivor, the only one who managed to come out safe in that flight that crashed and claimed more than 27 lives.\\n\\nAnd we now get you the story of the miraculous escape of the passenger of Providence. Yes, sources tell India today that uh the reason he got saved was because he landed between two buildings. The survivor had fallen on soft soil and that primarily saved the impact of his fall. That is how he managed to walk out. Vishwas Kumar the only survivor in that air crash where sources tell India today that uh the point at which he landed between two buildings there was no blast inside the aircraft and that is how passenger 11A Bishwas Kumar the only survivor of the Ahmedabad plane crash walked out after that devastating incident. Let me cut across to Amit Bhardwan joining us with further details. Amit, truly miraculous. You know, everyone has wondered how this happened and I believe you're picking up more details of uh primarily the fact that he landed between two buildings and landed on soft soil. These are the kind of incidents that remind us that there is a higher power and uh the one who's\",\n",
